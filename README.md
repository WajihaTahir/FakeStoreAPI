# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I created a Single Page Application using FakeStore API. I utilized the tech stacks of React framework and JavaScript to achieve the final website with good user experience. It contains the display page of all products, login, sign-up and delete account functionality using Firebase Auth. The user can sign-in after signing up and keep products in favourites and cart of their account. So whenever they login back they can have those items in the cart or they can also remove them from cart or favourites, increase quantity, decrease quantity and more.I created a Single Page Application using FakeStore API.
